Education
======

* Ph.D in Mathematical Modelling, Analysis and Computation, Maxwell Institute Graduate School, University of Edinburgh, 2024 (expected)
  * Currently working on statistical inference of a disease progression model applied to acute pancreatitis data. First year group projects involved stochastic modelling of gene expression and medical imaging.
* B.Sc. in Natural Sciences, University of Leeds, 2019 (1st)
  * Studied modules in Biology, Biochemistry and Mathematics. Final year project involved modelling HPV and investigating the effect of the HPV vaccination on cervical cancer rates in females.
* International study abroad year at Chinese University of Hong Kong 
  * Studied modules in C programming, Mandarin, Mathematics and Biochemistry. 


Industry experience

Skills
======
* Data Analysis
  * Experience in cleaning, analysing and visualising medical data sets for use in my research and presenting these results to non-mathematicians.
  * Experience cleaning, analysing, interpreting hospital and health data and using this to inform stakeholders and influence policy change.
* Programming 
  * Proficient in R, RShiny and Python with    experience in SPSS, Matlab and Mathematica.
* Communication
