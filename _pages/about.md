Welcome!
======
Hello, I'm Niamh and I am currently in my 4th year of the [MACMIGs](https://www.mac-migs.ac.uk/) programme at the universitities of Edinburgh and Heriot Watt. My reseach involves the statistical inference of a disease progression model fitted to clinical data mainly focussing on acute pancreatitis. The methods I use include time series analysis, missing data analysis and principal component analysis. I am currently working with [Dr Natalia Bochkina](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~nbochkin/) and [Professor Damian Mole](https://www.ed.ac.uk/surgery/staff/profiles/damian-mole). Additionally I am one of 4 co-founders of Remondata, a women's football data analysis platform.
